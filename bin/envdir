NAME
    __CMD__

SYNOPSIS
    __CMD__ d child

DESCRIPTION
    A script that emulates daemontools' envdir command
    <http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/envdir.html>

    d is a single argument. child consists of one or more arguments.

    envdir sources the file named d, or sets various environment variables as
    specified by files in the directory named d. It then runs child.

    If d contains a file named s whose first line is t, envdir adds an
    environment variable named s with value t. The name s must not contain =.
    Spaces and tabs at the end of t are removed. Nulls in t are changed to
    newlines in the environment variable.

    If the file s is completely empty (0 bytes long), envdir removes an
    environment variable named s if one exists, without adding a new variable.
